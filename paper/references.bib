  abstract = {The incumbent Internet of Things suffers from poor scalability and elasticity exhibiting in communication, computing, caching and control (4Cs) problems. The recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can potentially address the above problems of IoT systems. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive survey that overviews DRL algorithms and discusses DRL-enabled IoT applications. In particular, we first briefly review the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and present a comprehensive analysis on their advantages and challenges. We then discuss on applying DRL algorithms to a wide variety of IoT applications including smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, industrial IoT applications, mobile crowdsensing, and blockchain-empowered IoT. Meanwhile, the discussion of each IoT application domain is accompanied by an in-depth summary and comparison of DRL algorithms. Moreover, we highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving the further success of DRL in IoT applications.},

  abstract = {Battery-powered sensors deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these sensors observe a physical phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, the collected observations are expected to be correlated. In this paper, we propose an updating mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to take advantage of the exhibited correlation in the information collected. We implement the proposed updating mechanism employing deep Q-learning. Our mechanism is capable of learning the correlation in the information collected and determine the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates, while taking into consideration a highly dynamic environment. We evaluate our solution using environmental observations, namely temperature and humidity, obtained in a real deployment. We demonstrate that our mechanism is capable of adapting the transmission frequency of sensors' updates according to the everchanging environment. We show that our proposed mechanism is capable of significantly extending battery-powered sensors' lifetime without compromising the accuracy of the observations provided to the IoT service.},

  abstract = {This article provides a description of an Internet of Things (IoT) system that employs machine learning algorithms to provide real-time and precise insights into the health and behaviour of animals. A network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors strategically placed throughout the cattle area of the proposed system is capable of monitoring a variety of attributes, including temperature, humidity, grazing patterns, and movements. The information gathered by these sensors is wirelessly transmitted to a central centre, where it is analysed by algorithms that acquire expertise through practice. To extract meaningful results from acquired data, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented. The system maintains real-time surveillance of farmers or administrators and promptly alerts them to any anomalous events that may occur in regards to the animals' welfare or behaviour. This empowers them to expeditiously implement preventative measures against infections or optimise feeding regimens. Investigating historical data can yield significant insights that facilitate well-informed decision-making concerning enduring concerns like resource allocation or breeding initiatives. The incorporation of machine learning technology and the internet of things (IoT) into livestock management practices increases overall agricultural efficiency, productivity, and animal welfare.},
