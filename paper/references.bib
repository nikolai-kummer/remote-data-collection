  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technology employed in a variety of different applications, such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. In recent years, the number of IoT devices deployed globally has been increasing at a rapid pace and is estimated to reach 20 billion by the end of 2025. In modern industry, IoT plays a pivotal role by monitoring the condition of industrial machines and, consequently, improving the efficiency of industrial processes. To optimize the efficiency of industrial IoT applications, various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been adopted, leading to a new computing paradigm, namely, Industrial Artificial Intelligence of Things (i.e. Industrial AIoT). In this paper, we describe the challenges to tackle and the opportunities to explore in Industrial AIoT. Specifically, we first review the use of state-of-the-art AI methods in Industrial AIoT applications, with a focus on Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Thereafter, we present a series of important applications of Industrial AIoT. The key challenges associated with the implementation of Industrial AIoT applications are also discussed. In addition, the societal and economic impacts of Industrial AIoT are briefly described. Finally, we outline the future research directions in Industrial AIoT, which should be further investigated to fully utilize the potential of this innovative technology.},

The recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can potentially address the above problems of IoT systems. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive survey that overviews DRL algorithms and discusses DRL-enabled IoT applications. In particular, we first briefly review the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and present a comprehensive analysis on their advantages and challenges. We then discuss on applying DRL algorithms to a wide variety of IoT applications including smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, industrial IoT applications, mobile crowdsensing, and blockchain-empowered IoT. Meanwhile, the discussion of each IoT application domain is accompanied by an in-depth summary and comparison of DRL algorithms. Moreover, we highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving the further success of DRL in IoT applications.},

  abstract = {Continuous activity monitoring of dairy cattle is essential to acquire a comprehensive knowledge on health and well-being of the animals. In this research, we have reported the development and deployment of "MOOnitor", a neck-mounted intelligent IoT device for cattle monitoring. The device facilitates classification of salient activities of cattle through appropriately positioned sensors. MOOnitor is an integration of a temperature sensor, a global positioning system (GPS) module, and a 3-axis accelerometer in a lightweight enclosure, which is attached to a halter that allows transmission of data to an IoT server using a micro\- controller and a cellular GSM module. After acquiring the necessary sensory information, the most sig\- nificant features were strategically extracted for enhanced data interpretation. Thereafter, optimally tuned eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests classifiers were implemented to classify activ\- ities like `standing', `lying', `standing and ruminating', `lying and ruminating', `walking', and `walking and grazing'. The performances of the two classifiers towards identification of different cattle activities were compared in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the importance of using a temperature sensor and a GPS module in addition to an accelerometer in cattle activity recognition could be justified. An overall classi\- fication accuracy as high as {\textasciitilde}97\% was achieved using the XGBoost based classifier. In addition, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity for standing (0.98, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98), lying (0.97, 0.90, 1, 0.96), standing and ruminating (0.99, 1, 0.97, 1), lying and ruminating (0.99, 1, 0.83, 1), walking (1, 1, 1, 1), and walking and grazing (0.99, 1, 0.75, 1) shows the suitability of the proposed method in effective cattle activity monitoring. Since cattle activity states are indicative of various factors such as estrous and several diseases like mastitis, foot-and-mouth disease, etc, the MOOnitor may be used for early detection of these conditions in addition to general health monitoring.},

  abstract = {Battery-powered sensors deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these sensors observe a physical phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, the collected observations are expected to be correlated. In this paper, we propose an updating mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to take advantage of the exhibited correlation in the information collected. We implement the proposed updating mechanism employing deep Q-learning. Our mechanism is capable of learning the correlation in the information collected and determine the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates, while taking into consideration a highly dynamic environment. We evaluate our solution using environmental observations, namely temperature and humidity, obtained in a real deployment. We demonstrate that our mechanism is capable of adapting the transmission frequency of sensors' updates according to the everchanging environment. We show that our proposed mechanism is capable of significantly extending battery-powered sensors' lifetime without compromising the accuracy of the observations provided to the IoT service.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has become an indispensable part of the existing technological domain. Edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) together presents a new opportunity to imply machine learning techniques at the resource constrained embedded devices at the edge of the network. Conventional machine learning requires enormous amount of power to predict a scenario. Embedded machine learning -- TinyML paradigm aims to shift such plethora from traditional high-end systems to low-end clients. Several challenges are paved while doing such transition such as, maintaining the accuracy of learning models, provide train-to-deploy facility in resource frugal tiny edge devices, optimizing processing capacity, and improving reliability. In this paper, we present an intuitive review about such possibilities for TinyML. We firstly, present background of TinyML. Secondly, we list the tool sets for supporting TinyML. Thirdly, we present key enablers for improvement of TinyML systems. Fourthly, we present state-of-the-art about frameworks for TinyML. Finally, we identify key challenges and prescribe a future roadmap for mitigating several research issues of TinyML.},

A network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors strategically placed throughout the cattle area of the proposed system is capable of monitoring a variety of attributes, including temperature, humidity, grazing patterns, and movements. The information gathered by these sensors is wirelessly transmitted to a central centre, where it is analysed by algorithms that acquire expertise through practice. To extract meaningful results from acquired data, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented. The system maintains real-time surveillance of farmers or administrators and promptly alerts them to any anomalous events that may occur in regards to the animals' welfare or behaviour. This empowers them to expeditiously implement preventative measures against infections or optimise feeding regimens. Investigating historical data can yield significant insights that facilitate well-informed decision-making concerning enduring concerns like resource allocation or breeding initiatives. The incorporation of machine learning technology and the internet of things (IoT) into livestock management practices increases overall agricultural efficiency, productivity, and animal welfare.},
